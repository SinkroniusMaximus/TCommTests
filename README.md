# TCommTests

This used to be part of the TComm library, however now the library is separated from its examples, making for a cleaner implementation.


Edit: Now is based on the newest TComm library
If you are interested in running these two tests, use platformIO for the esp32 and use the mingw64 compiler for example for a the windows build.

# TCommTests

This used to be part of the TComm library, however now the library is separated from its examples, making for a cleaner implementation.


Edit: Now is based on the newest TComm library
If you are interested in running these two tests, use platformIO for the esp32 and use the mingw64 compiler for example for a the windows build.

What is demonstrated in this test is bidirectional communication between the OPC UA server and the ESP32.
One could expand on it by connecting multiple ESP32's and the OPC UA server will adapt automatically.

Remember the TComm project is based on MIT license, in short you can use it at will and there is no warranty.
